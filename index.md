# WELCOME to **#KEYDH** *!*

**[Call for proposals](cfp.md)**

We are excited to announce that this year's Keystone DH will be held at Penn State University in State College. Now in its fourth year, Keystone DH is an annual conference and a network of institutions and practitioners committed to advancing collaborative scholarship in digital humanities research and pedagogy across the Mid-Atlantic. Recognizing how DH scholarship in practice necessarily bridges conventional academic distinctions, we invite contributions from across the field, including faculty researchers, unaffiliated scholars, librarians, technologists, artists and critical-makers.
